## NASA Agroforestry Project

The NASA Agroforestry project takes place in various parts of the Brazilian and Peruvian forest. Recently, the project has aimed to focus mainly on the Peruvian side of the Amazon. The goal is to analyze deforestation rates over the years due to intensive agricultural practices. It has been observed on a continental level, and the data analysis process is being replicated onto Amazon Web Services.


##Overview 
This notebook demonstrates the mechanics of reading Landsat data from the AWS data lake. The primary goal is to create a composite image and generate NDVI for the greenest pixel, aiming for an annual average. Through this project we learn to import Landsat data into AWS using Sagemaker notebook. An Amazon Web services account is necessary to create your instance that supports the Jupyter notebook required for this code. 

To exercise this process, follow these steps:

1.Read the tutorials under the "Notebooks" file path
2. Start a SageMaker notebook in the US-West2 region.
3. Create the environment using the provided YML file.
4. Run the notebook.
5.
